# Search Algorithms Visualizer

An interactive GUI for visualizing and exploring search algorithms using Python and PyQt.

### 1. Install Python  
If you donâ€™t have Python installed:  
- Search on YouTube:`"install python [OS]", where OS is your operating system (e.g. Windows, Mac, Linux, ...) .  
- After installation, verify it by running:

```bash
python --version
```

### 2. Clone or Download the Project  
Make sure the project is in a folder on your machine. Then, open a terminal/console and navigate to that folder. Probably, you have already done that if you are reading this ;)

### 3. Install Dependencies  
Run this command to install all required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the Application  
Start the program using:

```bash
python -m Main.main
```

## Demo and Project Tour Videos
I have made two videos to go over this repo: a demo for showing the features of the app [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIs6ERL1wxE), and a tour of the project's motivation, process, and code [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bdsJaN9eOw).
