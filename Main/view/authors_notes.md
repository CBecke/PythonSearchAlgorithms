This GUI is made using PyQT6. As stated [here](https://realpython.com/python-pyqt-gui-calculator/#:~:text=PyQt%20is%20a%20Python%20binding,and%20many%20other%20powerful%20features.),
> If you check the code of your sample GUI application from the previous section, then you’ll notice that PyQt’s API doesn’t follow PEP 8 coding style and naming conventions. PyQt is built around Qt, which is written in C++ and uses the camel case naming style for functions, methods, and variables.

To comply with this I will therefore write in camel case here.
